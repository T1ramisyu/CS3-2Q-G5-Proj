                        The COVID-19 pandemic, swept across the world from early 2020 which brought unprecedented challenges to labor markets globally. With 
                        millions of people suddenly finding themselves out of work due to businesses closing their doors or halting operations to comply with 
                        public health mandates, unemployment rates skyrocketed in a manner not seen in decades. This paper addresses the trends of unemployment 
                        during evolution, the pandemic recovery phases, and demographic disparity together with the impact of the policies of the government.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        By early 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic had set in fully, the United States started to experience a rate of increase in unemployment 
                        that was unprecedented. In April 2020, the rate of unemployment stood at 13.0%, which had doubled since February 2020 when it was 3.6%. This 
                        was highly attributed to mass layoffs and closures of businesses in various sectors. The biggest impact was registered in hospitality and 
                        service-oriented businesses. This decline quickly translated to 21 million lost jobs between the close of the year 2019 and mid-2020, thus 
                        leading to economic instability and increased reliance on government support programs.

                        These rising unemployment rates have more profound effects on individuals in the long term, such as economic security and welfare. 
                        Unemployment heightens housing insecurity and food scarcity. Continued unemployment has been linked to poor health, including anxiety and 
                        depression for those without stable employment [3]. The worst affected were the vulnerable racial and ethnic minorities, making matters 
                        worse in terms of the effects of job loss both during and after the pandemic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This led to a mediocre job growth as the economy finally began to open up in late 2020 and persisted into 2021. As of the end of 2021, 
                        unemployment had decreased but was still at a high 4.2% level and was higher than the 3.6% of the last quarter of 2019 before the outbreak 
                        of the pandemic. Recoveries from the crisis took mixed forms; White unemployment had gone back to pre-crisis levels, but that for Blacks and 
                        Hispanics were considerably higher and therefore represent big labor market inequalities [3]. In 2021, the unemployment rate of Black people 
                        was at 7.1% while that of Hispanic people stood at 5.3%.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Highly instrumental in cushioning the economic shock for the unemployed workforce were government responses to the pandemic, such as 
                        increased benefits for unemployment. FPUC, introduced under the CARES Act, added $600 more per week to the unemployment fund initially [1]. 
                        This was considerably boosting financial support, though it was also affecting the job search behavior. In fact, some studies have reported 
                        that the decline in the number of applications for jobs is due to increased benefits, which raises the concern of labor market tightness [1]. 
                        However, overall employment measures continued to recover, and in 2022, returned to pre-pandemic levels.

                        The long-term impacts of the pandemic on the job market are still developing over time. The labor landscape has seen even more permanent 
                        changes in the nature of work, including the shift to remote work [2]. The employers are also facing a tightening labor market where higher 
                        competition among workers for skilled positions raises wage growth in sectors most affected by the pandemic, including hospitality and 
                        healthcare [2]. New technologies and automation, in essence, raise questions regarding the future of the labor market and the prevalence of 
                        job displacement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has made significant strides, the labor market continues to face persistent challenges that 
                        require attention.​ The disparities that have emerged during this period will be critical to creating an equitable economic recovery, as well 
                        as continued adaptability to the changing work environment and advances in technology. The tremendous staying power exerted by the pandemic 
                        calls for continuous vigor on part of policymakers in their pursuit of both the workforce and the general economy.
